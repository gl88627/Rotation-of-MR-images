# Rotation-of-MR-images
rot_FT2_Matrix.m generates a rotated two-dimensional Fourier transform matrix

image_normalization.mat will normalize the image so the maximum intensity of an image is 1

mri.png is a MR brain image

example.m shows an example of using rot_FT2_Matrix. In this code, the K-space (frequency domain) of an MR brain image is rotated using the matrix generated from rot_FT2_Matrix. This rotation in K-space corresponds to the same rotation in spacial domain
